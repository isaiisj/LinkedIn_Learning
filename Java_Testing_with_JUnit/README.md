<h1>Java: Testing with JUnit</h1>
<p>Unit testing is of crucial importance in developing stable applications. Java developers need to write unit tests, and JUnit is 
  the main unit testing framework for Java. In this course, trainer and developer Maaike van Putten helps you learn to test your 
  Java code effectively. Maaike explains what unit testing is and the advantages that it offers. She covers JUnit and shows you 
  how to set it up and run your first test. Maaike steps through the process of writing a basic test, including useful tools like 
  JUnit Annotations, JUnit Write, JUnit DisplayName, and more. She goes over more advanced uses of JUnit, such as dependency injection,
  parameterized tests, and timeouts, to name a few. Maaike finishes up with a quick peek at next steps you can take, like how to make 
  code ready for unit testing, best practices, and a brief overview of Mockito.</p>
